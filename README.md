# COL106-Assignments
### 1st to 3rd Assignment is based on Dynamic Memory Allocation in our Systems
* The repo comprise of 3 Assignments
* 1st-Assignment -> Implementation using Doubly Linked List
* 2nd-Assignment -> Implementation using Binary Search Tree
* 3rd-Assignment -> Implementation using AVL Tree
###### Efficency of Memory Allocator System improves assignment by assignment

* For more information on Assignments 1,2,3 -> read PDF file

### 4th Assignment
#### Allowed_Imports
* You can only use the libraries mentioned in allowed_imports.txt
#### Compare.py 
* Compares 2 files i.e. matches whether your output is correct or not. 
* To use, replace the second file in place of filename2 with your output file 
#### Input
* Edges.csv and Nodes.csv files contain vertices and edges of the graph
* To run this repo, clone this repo and run javac assignment4.java followed by java assignment4
* input.txt will take care of input 
* For more information on Assignment 4 -> read PDF file

#### More Testcases
* I have uploaded 2 test cases with roughly 2 lakh and 8 lakh vertices.
* These are dense graphs which might help you to test the correctness and time complexity of your code.
* I have attached my outputs and the time taken to compute them in the avg_data1_data2.txt file. 
* Also attached compare.py function, which might help to debug in case outputs doesn't match.
* Link for inputs: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1csvT4GrG7a5Kk_kLWXr5szl8ALQAF11Q?usp=sharing
* The edge file also contains multiple edges between nodes.
* Replace "dfs2_prakhar.txt" ( FileOutputStream f = new FileOutputStream("dfs2_prakhar.txt") ) to the file name in which you want the output.

##### P.S: Use java -Xss32m assignment4 command to avoid Stack Overflow error.
##### Considering the input size of data2 (in drive), close other files to ensure that your code run smoothly and your pc doesn't hang
#### Enjoy Coding :)
